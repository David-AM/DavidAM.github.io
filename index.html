        <h1>Zurich's Hills</h1>
        <p>Switzerland's mountains are amazing. However, its "hills" are pretty awesome too.
          This map shows the <span class="indicator home">hills around Zurich in contour lines.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="title home">Overview</p>
        <p>On the west side of Zurich Lake (called Zürichsee in German),
          the <span class="indicator albis">Albis chain</span>
          stretches for about 19km.
          Being very near to the city of Zurich, the area is heavily visited, especially near its northern end,
          and includes a large number of restaurants along the summit (from Uetliberg to Mätteli),
          as well as hiking trails.
          On the <span class="indicator east">east side,</span>
          a range of peaks separate Greifensee from Zürichsee.
          The upper part of the mountain is mostly woodland and a popular recreational area with picnic sites.
          In winter season a cross-country skiing trail is a popular point of interest.
        </p>
        <p class="title uetliberg"> Uetliberg</p>
        <p><span class="indicator uetliberg">Uetliberg (also known as Üetliberg)</span>
          is a mountain in the Swiss plateau, part of the Albis chain, rising to 870 m (2,850 ft).
          The mountain offers an impressive panoramic view of the entire city of Zurich and the Lake of Zurich
          and it's a popular attraction for tourists. A train takes tourists from the main station in Zurich all the
          way to Utto Kulm, the summit of Uetliberg.
        </p>
        <p class="title zurichberg">Zürichberg</p>
        <p>The <span class="indicator zurichberg">Zürichberg</span>
          is a wooded hill rising to 679 m (2,228 feet), overlooking Lake Zurich and located
          immediately to the east of the city of Zurich. It is a picturesque location, and the lower western
          side of the hill is now part of the residential district of Zurich. The Zurich Zoo and FIFA's
          headquarters are located on the Zürichberg as well. The upper part of the hill is mostly woodland
          and a popular recreational area.
